 Bayesian Temporal Risk Modeling
This repository demonstrates Bayesian temporal modeling for early physiological screening using synthetic multimodal biosignal data.
The project emphasizes:
 Uncertainty-aware probabilistic modeling
 Temporal persistence analysis
 Multimarker evaluation (temperature, SpO₂, urea, HRV)
All data is synthetic and reproducible. This project is for research demonstration purposes only and does not provide medical diagnosis.
